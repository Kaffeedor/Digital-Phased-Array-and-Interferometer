# Digital Phased Array And Interferometer
Python Programm for my Array for Hydrogen Line.

## Plans:
  - Make a mainly Keberossdr (and also generally RTL-SDR later) compatible Python based software to record Signals individually and then process them.
  - Options to choose between processing like a Interferometer or Phased Array
  - At the Phased Array option make an option to do a small image with digital phasing

## Software to use bcs i dont wanna do it all myself:
  - Virgo by 0xCoto
  - GNURadio and Osmosdr
  - different python packages
